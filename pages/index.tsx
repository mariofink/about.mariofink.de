        Hi, my name is Mario Fink üëãüèª
        <br /> I live in the beautiful Rh√∂n (a rural area in the midst of
        Germany) together with my wife and my two sons. Currently I work as a
        web developer at Goodyear Dunlop Tires in Fulda.

        Since 2003 I have been working in a 10-person team as lead frontend
        developer and UX designer ‚Äì creating a B2B shop that is used throughout
        Europe, Middle East and South Africa (EMEA). My main responsibilities

      <SubHeading>Education</SubHeading>
      <Paragraph>
        I finished my technical diploma in Economics & Management in 1999. After
        spending a year in community service (aka. Zivildienst) I started an
        apprenticeship as IT specialist at Goodyear Dunlop Tires that I finished
        successfully in 2003. Thereafter I accepted a job offering at the same
        company to work on its B2B shop as a web developer.
